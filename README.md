# ictfromabc clone (React based)
Redesigning the UI (maybe some inner workings :D) of [ictfromabc](https://ictfromabc.com) website using React. Note that this is a preview version of the user interface. The interface is not yet fully supported for mobile devices. All SVG icons are borrowed from [svgrepo.com](https://www.svgrepo.com/) website for free of charge.

## If running on your local machine
> **The built (exported) version will be released soon. Until then,** Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is installed. (My version is `v20.15.0`) After that, You can open the terminal in the path where this project is located and run the `npm install` command followed by `npm start`. You should be able to see it open in the default web browser. If not, Just [Google](https://www.google.com) ðŸ˜„ (maybe you missed something along the way)
