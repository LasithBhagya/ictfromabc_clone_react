# ictfromabc clone (React based)
Redesigning the UI (maybe some inner workings :D) of [ictfromabc](https://ictfromabc.com) website using React.

## If running on your local machine
> Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is installed. (My version is `v20.15.0`) After that, You can open the terminal in the path you located this project and run the
command `npm start`. You should be able to see it open up in the default web browser. If not, Just [Google](https://www.google.com) ðŸ˜„ (maybe you have missed something on the way)
